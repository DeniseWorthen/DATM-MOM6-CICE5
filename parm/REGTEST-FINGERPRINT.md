DATM-MOM6-CICE5 Compset Data Fingerprint File
=============================================

This file documents the compset input and baseline data stored
outside the repository.  It also serves as a verification method 
to ensure the data directory in use matches the one desired by 
this version of the application. Therefore, anytime there is an 
update to the compset inputs or baseline data, this file needs 
to be updated in the data storage area and in the repository.
